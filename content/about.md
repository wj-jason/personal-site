## Hello! 👋

My names Jason, I'm an Electrical & Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto, going into my 2nd year. I'm interested in research and development in ML, low level design, computer hardware, and low latency systems.

I'm currently doing research in networks and distributed systems at UofT with the iQua research group, and I have previous research experience building computer vision models with the National Research Council of Canada. 

Off to the side, I'm building a lightweight hierarchical classification library for use in UTMIST x Aercoustics construction noise classification project.
